This paper proposes a novel Water-wave Information Transmission (WIT) framework, which captures both long- and short-term repetitive patterns through bi-granular information transmission. It also models global and local correlations by recursively fusing and selecting information using Horizontal Vertical Gated Selective Unit (HVGSU). In addition, to improve the computing efficiency, we propose a generic Recurrent Acceleration Network (RAN) which reduces the time complexity to $O(\sqrt L)$ while maintaining the memory complexity at $O(L)$.
