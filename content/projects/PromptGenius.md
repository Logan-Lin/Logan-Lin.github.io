This project focuses on developing a website that offers a wide range of prompt categories, enhancing the versatility of LLMs for various tasks and improving their output quality.

**My major contributions include:**

- Independently designed and implemented the website's frontend and backend using HTML, JavaScript, Flask, and SQLite.

The website has supported over 60k users worldwide in the past year and currently serves more than five users per month.
