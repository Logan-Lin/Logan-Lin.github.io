> Topic: [[Spatiotemporal Data Mining]], [[Representation Learning]], [[Trajectory Data Mining]]

This project aims to propose pre-training representation learning methods for spatial-temporal trajectory data, modeling multiple features to improve traffic prediction tasks. It demonstrates how trajectory representation learning can enhance traffic data mining.

**My major contributions include:**

- I conducted pioneering research on pre-training techniques for spatial-temporal data, with relevant results published in [[TALE]] and [[CTLE]].
- I originated the concept for this project and wrote the proposal.
- I developed a pre-training representation learning method for trajectory data to improve traffic prediction accuracy, with findings published in [[MMTEC]].
- I independently completed the development of the project's [data mining platform](http://demo.insis.com.cn:8200/), which serves as a demonstration tool.
