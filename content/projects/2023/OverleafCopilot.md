This project aims to develop a Browser extension to seamlessly integrate Large Language Models (such as ChatGPT) into the popular online academic writing platform, [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com).

**My major contributions include:**

- Independently developed the database and backend supporting the core functionalities of the extension.
- Independently implemented the [product homepage](https://www.overleafcopilot.com/).
- Lead the development of the extension using JavaScript and HTML.

The extension currently has 3,000+ active users from 70+ institutes around the world. (Source: [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/overleaf-copilot/eoadabdpninlhkkbhngoddfjianhlghb))
