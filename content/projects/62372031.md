This project explores how to generate high-quality spatial-temporal trajectory data and corresponding representations to address sparsity-related issues, thereby supporting a variety of downstream tasks.

**My major contributions include:**

- I conceived the core idea for this project, leading the proposal writing and contributing substantially to its content.
- I developed a representation learning approach to address label sparsity in trajectory mining, with results published in [[MMTEC]]. 
- I mentored two PhD students (Tonglong Wei and Letian Gong) in our research group, collaborating on the design of methods for representation learning, imputation, and generation of human and vehicle trajectories.
